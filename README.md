## Preparations

- Ensure your environment is well configured in Agora Console, if you are not sure what to do, please contact our technical support.
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure the following parameters:
  - **(Required) The Agora App ID that you get**
  ```bash
  # Agora App ID
  REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_ID=agora appId
  REACT_APP_AGORA_LOG=true
  ELECTRON_START_URL=http://localhost:3000
  ```
  - **(Required) The Agora Customer ID and Customer Secret that you get**
  ```bash
REACT_APP_AGORA_APP_ID=<YOUR APPID>
REACT_APP_NETLESS_APP_ID=<YOUR NETLESS APPID>
  ```

- Install Node.js LTS

## Run the Web demo
1. Install npm
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Locally run the Web demo
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Create distribution Classroom SDK
   ```
   npm run pack:npm
   ```

After running, a `dist` folder that contains an edu_sdk.bundle.js will be generated.

## FAQ
- If you find your localhost:3000 port already exists or has been used, you can change `ELECTRON_START_URL=http://localhost:3000` in `package.json` to an available port, and then run it again.
